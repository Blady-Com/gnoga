Gnoga can be installed as a GNAT standard library on many platforms and
can always be used from its own directory.

1) To install release version in "inst_folder" directory:

$ make BUILD_MODE=Release install

gnoga_make will also be installed in to the bin directory. Make sure to
check the permission on the gnoga_make executable as some versions of gprinstall
fail to correctly change permissions to execute for all users.

In your gpr file use:
with "gnoga.gpr"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr:/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat

Tips: "make help" will give your actual INSTALL folder.

I you don't have Sqlite3, you can do before (automatic for Windows):
$ make sqlite3

The HTML files and Javascript plugins are in /path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gnoga.


2) To install debug version in "inst_folder" directory:

$ make install

Usage is same as release install.


3) Installation directory:

By default Gnoga and dependent libraries are installed in /path/to/gnoga/inst_folder directory.
Installation is customizable with PREFIX, as for instance:

make PREFIX=/path/to/install install

In your gpr file use:
with "gnoga.gpr"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/install/share/gpr -aP/path/to/install/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/install/share/gpr:/path/to/install/lib/gnat
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/install/share/gpr;/path/to/install/lib/gnat

NB: Zanyblue installation doesn't support paths including space character.


4) Using from Gnoga's own directory without installing in debug build mode:
(to play with Gnoga source code, demos, tutorials or even tests)

make all

In your own gpr file add GPR full path for Gnoga and other projects needed:
with "/path/to/gnoga/src/gnoga.gpr" (instead of with "gnoga.gpr").
That's all.

If you want to add only GPR names:
with "gnoga.gpr";
with "zanyblue.gpr";
...

then add these options to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/src -aP/path/to/gnoga/deps/zanyblue/src -aP/path/to/gnoga/deps/PragmARC
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/src:/path/to/gnoga/deps/zanyblue/src:/path/to/gnoga/deps/PragmARC
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=path\to\gnoga\src;path\to\gnoga\deps\zanyblue\src;path\to\gnoga\deps\PragmARC

These options are automatically computed for you with gnoga-config.
The script is created a first time with makefile and then can be use without makefile.
gnoga-config sets the search project directories for gprbuild.

a) For Windows users:
Usage:
> cd path\to\gnoga
> make gnoga-config
> cd <your-stuff>
> path\to\gnoga\bin\gnoga-config gprbuild -P your-project.gpr your-main.adb
(your-project.gpr just have to include 'with "gnoga.gpr";')
You can also add path\to\gnoga\bin to your PATH and then just do:
gnoga-config gprbuild -P your-project.gpr your-main.adb

b) For Unix like users:
Usage:
$ cd /path/to/gnoga
$ make gnoga-config
$ cd <your-stuff>
$ gprbuild -P your-project.gpr your-main.adb `/path/to/gnoga/bin/gnoga-config`
(your-project.gpr just have to include 'with "gnoga.gpr";')
You can also add /path/to/gnoga/bin to your PATH and then just do:
$ gprbuild -P your-project.gpr your-main.adb `gnoga-config`

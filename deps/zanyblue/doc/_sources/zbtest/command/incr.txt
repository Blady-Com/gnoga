The ``incr`` Command
====================

``incr``, increment a parameter value::

    incr [ -a ] name

Increment an integer parameter value.  The parameter must already
exist and it's value is incremented by one.  This operation breaks the
scoping models as the value is updated in the first scope the defines
the parameter.  If this is deeper than the current scope, the incremented
value is retained after the current scope ends.  If the -a option is given
all instances of the parameter in all scopes is incremented (this is the
mechanism used to increment the number of OK and failure tests).

Examples::

    ZBTest> set -i num 0
    ZBTest> incr num
    Incremented the parmeter "num" to 1
    ZBTest> begin
    ZBTest> incr num
    Incremented the parmeter "num" to 2
    ZBTest> print num
    2
    ZBTest> end
    ZBTest> print num
    2

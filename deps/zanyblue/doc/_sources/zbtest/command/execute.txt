The ``execute`` Command
=======================

``execute``, execute a system command::

    execute [ -f | -s | -o output ] command [ command-arg ... ]

Execute a command given the command name and an optional list
of command arguments.  The command to execute is located by

#. Searching from the current test directory up the directory tree
   for an executable with the command name in a bin directory, i.e.,
   if executing a command built in the current source tree.

#. Or, searching the value of the "path" list parameter (initialized to
   the value of the "PATH" environment variable).

The search attempts to find the first file with an extension defined by
the "exes" list parameter that matches the command name.  For example,
on Windows, the directories listed on the "path" parameter are searched
for files with extensions "bat", "cmd", "com" or "exe".

Once an executable is found, a new process is spawned to execute it.
If the "-o" option is given, then the command output (standard output
and standard error) is sent to the named file.

The "-s" option defines a command that is expected to execute successfully.
This is the default and the "-s" option is normally not given.

The "-f" option defines a command that is expected fail (non-zero exit
status).

An execute failure file is generated if a command does not exit with the
expected status.

Examples

#. Execute the "ls" command, the output is sent to the "screen"::

    ZBTest> execute ls

#. Execute the "ls" command, the output is sent to the the file "ls.out"
   in the test area::

    ZBTest> execute -o ls.out ls

#. Execute the "ls" command, the output is sent to the the file "ls.out"
   in the test area.  The command is expected to exit with a failure
   status in this case, i.e., the file "nosuchfile" is not expected to
   exist::

    ZBTest> execute -f -o ls.out ls nosuchfile

The "execute" command is normally used with the "-o" option generating
a log file for comparision with a reference log file via the ZBTest
function "nextlog".

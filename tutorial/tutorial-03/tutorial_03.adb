--  is no issue of concurrency outside of events from the same user. This
--  allowed for programming in the familiar sequential patterns of regular
--  console applications. In this tutorial we will create an application that
--  will allow for multiple connections on the same machine, network or across
--  the globe on the internet.

--  In order to help see the different approach to setting up the application
--  we will do something similar to the previous tutorial.

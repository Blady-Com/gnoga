rename: rename a file in the test area

    Usage: rename old-name new-name

Rename a file in the test area.  This is frequently used to rename
files generated by applications to standard log file names.

Example::

    ZBTest> rename generate.dat myapp-01.log

Using the "nextlog" function would be more robust here, e.g.,::

    ZBTest> rename generate.dat $(nextlog)

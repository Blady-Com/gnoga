Welcome to Gnoga
----------------

These tutorials are designed to introduce you in a practical and efficient way
in to programming Ada with Gnoga.

Gnoga is a collection of Ada packages, we will call such a collection a
development framework, designed to allow Ada programs to make use of the
latest web technologies both on the internet and on the desktop.

Each tutorial has a README that will help you understand what to look for
in the tutorial application to get you up to speed using Gnoga in your own
applications quickly.

After reading the tutorial README carefully read through the tutorial
application code and all comments with in the code.

Each tutorial is built by changing in to the directory and running gprbuild,
for example:

cd tutorial-01
gprbuild

Once the executable has been built it will be in the gnoga/bin directory.
To see the tutorial in action run the executable there and open a web browser
to http://localhost:8080

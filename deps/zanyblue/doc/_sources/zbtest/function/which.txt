The ``which`` Function
======================

which [ -f | -e ] filename


The "which" function returns the path to a file searched on the
"searchpath" list, using the "-f" option (the default) or an executable
on the "path" list, using the "-e" option.

The "which" function is primarily used to determine where applications are
installed with the result normally processed by the "dirname" function to
to determine the parent directory, e.g.::

    ZBTest> set project_dir $(dirname $(dirname $(which zbmcompile)))

where "project_dir" is set to "/usr" for an installed "zbmcompile"
located at "/usr/bin/zbmcompile".

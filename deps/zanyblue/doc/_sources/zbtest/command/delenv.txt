The ``delenv`` Command
======================

``delenv``, delete an environment variable::

    delenv name

Delete an environment variable.  The value of the variable, if any,
is restored on exiting the current scope.

Examples::

  ZBTest> begin
  ZBTest> delenv HOME
  Deleting environment variable "HOME"
  ZBTest> end
  Executing the 'undo' action "setenv HOME "/home/mrohan""
  Setting the environment variable "HOME" to "/home/mrohan"

Any commands executed after the "delenv" until the end of the scope will
not see a value for the environment variable.

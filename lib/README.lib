This directory contains release gpr files for gnoga.

After running make gnoga this directory will contain the .ali files fo both and
Gnoga and Simple_Components and libgnoga.a for static linking of both. The .ali
files are marked readonly to recognize that there should be no reconsideration
for recompiling the libs. ../include will contain the matching Ada specs.

To include gnoga in your projects that have not used the global install option
just with the gnoga.gpr file from this directory.

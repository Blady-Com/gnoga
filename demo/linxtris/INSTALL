LinXtris Version 0.1a2 port on Gnoga:

This project is just begining so I haven't made an installation script yet.

To compile this game you must have the Gnat compiler.

Get Gnoga with:
$ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/gnoga/code gnoga-code

To compile type:
$ make linxtris

And to run:
$ bin/linxtris -data_dir demo/linxtris/

Hope you enjoy!

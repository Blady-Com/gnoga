The ``dirname`` Function
========================

dirname path


The "dirname" function takes a path as an argument and returns the
containing directory.  It is used in the zbmcompile tests to determine the
installation directory for the zbmcompile executable, e.g.,::

    ZBTest> set project_dir $(dirname $(dirname $(which zbmcompile)))\n

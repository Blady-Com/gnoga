zbtest.help (2) 
zbtest.help (3) help execute
Execute a command given the command name and an optional list
of command arguments.  The command to execute is located by search the
value of the "path" list parameter (initialized to the value of the "PATH"
environment variable).  The search attempts to find the first file with
an extension defined by the "exes" list parameter that matches the command
name.  For example, on Windows, the directories listed on the "path" parameter
are searched for files with extensions "bat", "cmd", "com" or "exe".

Once an executable is found, a new process is spawned to execute it.
If the "-o" option is given, then the command output (standard output
and standard error) is sent to the named file.

The "-s" option defines a command that is expected to execute successfully.
This is the default and the "-s" option is normally not given.

The "-f" option defines a command that is expected fail (non-zero exit
status).

An execute failure file is generated if a command does not exit with the
expected status.

Examples:

    ZBTest> execute ls
       Execute the "ls" command, the output is sent to the "screen".

    ZBTest> execute -o ls.out ls
       Execute the "ls" command, the output is sent to the the file "ls.out"
       in the test area.

    ZBTest> execute -f -o ls.out ls nosuchfile
       Execute the "ls" command, the output is sent to the the file "ls.out"
       in the test area.  The command is expected to exit with a failure
       status in this case, i.e., the file "nosuchfile" is not expected to
       exist.

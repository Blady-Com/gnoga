Inorder to deploy your apps for production you need to have the following
directory structure:

App Dir
  |
  |___ bin - your gnoga app binary
  |
  |___ html - boot.html (or other boot loader used)
  |
  |___ js - must contain jquery.min.js
  |
  |___ css - optional, a directory for serving css files
  |
  |___ img - optional, a directory of serving graphics.

You can use Gnoga.Application.Lauch_URL_* to start the default browser
pointed to the Gnoga app on startup.

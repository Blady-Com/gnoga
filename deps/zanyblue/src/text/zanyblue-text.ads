package ZanyBlue.Text is

   No_Such_Facility_Error : exception;
   --  Exception raised when accessing a message associated with an undefined
   --  facility.  The name of the unknown facility (or index, if accessing the
   --  message data by indexes) is included as an exception message.

   No_Such_Key_Error : exception;
   --  The exception raised when attempting to query for an unknown key value.
   --  The facility and key values separated by a '/' character are included
   --  in the exception message.  These are index values if accessing the
   --  message data by index.

   No_Such_Locale_Error : exception;
   --  The locale supplied is not referenced in the catalog.  This exception
   --  does not indiciate the locale is an invalid locale name.

   No_Such_Message_Error : exception;
   --  The exception raised when a message cannot be found for a particular
   --  facility, key and local triple, e.g., the key exists in some locale
   --  for the facility but not in the locale required.  The facility and
   --  key values separated by a '/' character are included in the exception
   --  message.  Again, these are index values if accessing the message data
   --  by index.

   No_Such_Argument_Error : exception;
   --  This exception is raised when formatting a message that includes a
   --  reference to an argument beyond the set supplied by the user, e.g.,
   --  referencing argument number 5 when only 2 arguments were supplied.
   --  If formatting exceptions are disabled, then the a reference to the
   --  argument number is included in the formatted string.

   Invalid_Format_Error : exception;
   --  This exception is raised if the format string includes syntax errors
   --  wrt the micro-grammar for references, e.g., an argument reference
   --  does not have a corresponding closing '}'.

   Internal_Error : exception;
   --  The exception raised when an inconsistency is detected and represents
   --  a bug in the implementation.

   Unicode_Escape_Error : exception;
   --  The exception raised when processing Unicode escape sequences in a
   --  string that do not contain hexadecimal values, e.g., "\u00xy" would
   --  raise this error.  The exception is raised with the character that
   --  is not a hexadecimal character.  It can also be raised in the context
   --  of loading a properties file, in which case the exception is raised
   --  with the file name, line number and offending character as colon
   --  separated arguments.

   Unicode_Format_Error : exception;
   --  The exception raised when a Unicode escaped string is converted to
   --  a Wide_String.

   Duplicate_Key_Error : exception;
   --  This exception is raised when a duplicate key definition is encountered
   --  when processing .properties file.  The exception is raised with the
   --  file name, the duplicate key value, the line number for the duplicate
   --  definition and the line number for the original definition as colon
   --  separated arguments, e.g., "myfile.properties:0001: 10: 5".

   Unsupported_Radix_Error : exception;
   --  When formatting floating point values, the value needs to be inspected.
   --  The inspection support machine radix values of 2, 4, 8 or 16.  This
   --  execption is raised if executed on a system that uses a different value.

   Internal_Container_Error : exception;
   --  Internally, the Text library used the Ada.Containers types to store
   --  the message data.  There are some conditions where errors might be
   --  indicated by the Containers library.  If these errors occurs this
   --  exception is raised.  These conditions are all in the category of
   --  "should never happen", e.g., a failure to get after a successful
   --  lookup.

   Pool_Size_Mismatch_Error : exception;
   --  The "zbmcompile" utility compiles messages into Ada sources.  The
   --  string data is accumulated and eventually written to an Ada source
   --  file as the value of a Pool string.  If this string contains non-Latin
   --  characters, the compilation must use options that allow non-Latin
   --  source character, e.g., "-gnatW8" for GNAT.  If not given, the non-Latin
   --  characters are interpreted as two individual characters increasing the
   --  size of the Pool.  If the compiled length of the Pool does not match
   --  length generated by the "zbmcompile" utility, this exception is raised.

   Invalid_Static_Message_Error : exception;
   --  Internal error

   Multiple_Pools_Error : exception;
   --  Internal error

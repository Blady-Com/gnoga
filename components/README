Install components in your local project by copying the entire compnent to your
local subdirectory components and then running the containing Makefile with:
make install

If you wish to install the component into your global Gnoga installation (it
will become part of libgnoga.a) cd to the component and run: make install
there. Then you _must_ rerun the make gonga make file with: make gnoga
that will add the new component to libgnoga.a

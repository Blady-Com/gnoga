   --  On each connection an Application_Connect_Event registered in
   --  On_Connect_Handler will be called. Main_Window will be attached
   --  to the window of the browser. Connection can optionally be used
   --  to allow for "clean up" upon close of connection, or to prevent
   --  finalization of the called Application_Connect_Event procedure
   --  until the connection is closed. This allows for Gnoga objects to
   --  be created on the stack within the procedure and not be finalized
   --  prematurely and still able to respond to events, etc.
   --  Use: Connection.Hold;

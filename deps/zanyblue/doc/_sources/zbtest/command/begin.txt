.. _zb-zbtest-commands-begin:

The ``begin`` Command
=====================

``begin``, begin a new parameter scope::

    begin

The ``begin`` command starts a new ZBTest scope for parameters definitions.
This is similar to standard scoping in programming languages, local
definitions "hide" definitions in enclosing scopes, e.g.,::

   set x 10
   begin
   set x 11
   # References to the parameter "x" yield 11 here
   end
   # References to the parameter "x" yield 10 here

Scopes allow tests to inherit definitions from enclosing scopes and
localize parameter definitions and changes to the current test, restoring
values on scope exit via the :ref:`zb-zbtest-commands-end` command.

It is not normally necessary to explicitly begin a scope using the
``begin`` command, scopes are implicitly created on starting the execution
of a ZBTest script via the :ref:`zb-zbtest-commands-run` command.

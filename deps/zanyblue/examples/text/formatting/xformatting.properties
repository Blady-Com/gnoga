banner=This is FORMATTING, Version {0}.{1}.{2} - {3}
usage=Usage: ex_text_formatting [ -xu | -xl | -xh | -xe | -llocale ]
help=This example application shows the various numeric formatting options\n\
available with the ZanyBlue library, e.g., print an integer in binary,\n\
"'{0,b}'" or aligning the formatted value within a field width, etc.\n\
\n\
Final example shows the formatting of missing arguments with ZanyBlue\n\
formatting exceptions are disabled.

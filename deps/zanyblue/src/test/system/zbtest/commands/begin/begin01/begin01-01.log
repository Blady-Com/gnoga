Start a new scope level.  Variable assignments, e.g.,

    set xyx abc

retain their effect for the lifetime of the scope.  Ending the scope
using the "end" command restores any previous values for the parameters
adjusted during the scope.

It is not normally necessary to explicitly begin a new scope, each test
script run automatically starts a new scope which is automatically ended
when the test script completes.

The "begin" command does not have options.

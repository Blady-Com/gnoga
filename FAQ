Q) Can I distribute programs I compile with Gnoga?

A) If you use GNAT-FSF or GNAT-PRO you can distribute the binaries with out your source, since Gnoga and those versions of GNAT grant an exception if the libraries where not modified only compiled against. If you use GNAT-GPL, according to AdaCore your code will fall under the GPL license with out exception which means you would need to distribute the source with your binary, now is that a bad thing?! However.. Keep in mind that if you modify Gnoga, or add to it, you will need to distribute those sources. Of course if you are doing that you should be sharing them with all of use to make Gnoga better :)

Q) How do I get AWS on Mac so I can use Gnoga with GNAT?

A) You can either download the source package from any other distro of GNAT GPL or git clone the AWS repo, git clone --recursive http://forge.open-do.org/anonscm/git/aws/aws.git  Once you have unpacked it, to build you will need to set the include path to include the needed C libraries (included as part of Xcode) that do not come with the GNAT GPL or GNAT FSF versions. The following is an example on Mavericks:

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/usr/include

after that you can do the regular: make setup build install

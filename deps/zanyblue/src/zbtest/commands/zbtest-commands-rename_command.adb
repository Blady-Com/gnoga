--  @usage rename old-name new-name
--  @summary rename a file in the test area
--  @start-doc
--  Rename a file in the test area.  This is frequently used to rename
--  files generated by applications to standard log file names.
--
--  Example::
--
--      ZBTest> rename generate.dat myapp-01.log
--
--  Using the "nextlog" function would be more robust here, e.g.,::
--
--      ZBTest> rename generate.dat $(nextlog)

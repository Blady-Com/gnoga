Q) Where can I learn more about Gnoga?

A) http://www.gnoga.com, going to the sourceforge site, and most importantly joining the gnoga mailing list at - https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gnoga-list. Reading the sources tests and demos are also a good place to start.

Q) What licenses does Gnoga use?

A) Gnoga is under the GNAT modified GPLv3 with runtime exceptions which means Gnoga can be used in proprietary applications and along side any license you wish, however any modifications, extensions, etc. of Gnoga itself fall under the same license as Gnoga for those changes alone and that source must be made available for distribution with your binaries, but it does not affect the rest of your code other code or require open sourcing any of it.

Q) Why does Gnoga use the GPL with run time exceptions and not the full GPL license?

A) One goal of Gnoga is to encourage the use of Ada for general use  modern software development, forcing applications to be under the GPL license would limit that goal. However those of use believing in the idea of "free" software would encourage choosing a "free" license for your projects.

Q) Can I distribute programs I compile with Gnoga as proprietary applications?

A) Yes, unless you have used the GNAT-GPL shareware version from libre, which showcases AdaCore's GNAT-PRO distribution of gcc/ada. Their "GPL" version is designed to pass the "GPL virus" too anything compiled with it to encourage purchasing their support packages. You can find excellent pro quality unencumbered distributions of gcc/ada at http://GetAdaNow.com

Q) Can I build native Gtk Apps with Gnoga?

A) Yes, see docs/native_gtk_apps.md for how.

Q) Can I Build native Mac OS X applications with Gnoga.

A) See docs/native_osx_apps.md

Q) Can I launch a browser on start up to access by Gnoga Application?

A) Yes, use Gnoga.Applications.Open_URL

Q) How do I use Gnoga with MinGW or Cygwin on Windows 32 or 64bits?

A) Gnoga by default uses gprtools that are not included with those distros. The makefile contains simple directions of what to comment and uncomment in order to use gnatmake and gnatclean under MSYS or Cygwin environments. You can also compile Gnoga from the regular Windows command line see make_on_windows.bat and clean_on_windows.bat.

Q) How to compile Gnoga on Debian (wheezy)?

A) You will need to use a more recent version of gcc/ada currently as Wheezy uses gcc/ada 4.6 and the minimum requirement for Gnoga is 4.7. Using the gcc/ada from Debian Jesse (4.9) works well.

Q) How to use Gnoga on a Raspberry Pi?

A) If you are using Raspbian you need to make sure it is Raspbian based on Debian Jessie or later. If you are running the Raspbian based on Wheezy you can use the following to upgrade you Pi to Jessie:

sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
--  change all references to wheezy to jessie

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade 
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

sudo apt-get install gnat

Q) Do I need Sqlite3 or MySQL installed to use Gnoga?

A) Only if you choose to build database apps or compile the database examples. 

Q) How do I get sqlite3 and MySQL on my Mac for use with Gnoga?

Sqlite3 is already built in to Mac OS X. You would only need to install MySQL if you wanted to run the MySQL test or wanted to use MySQL. There are many ways to install the need MySQL client libraries on Mac OS X, http://brew.sh/ is a simple solution. Here is a simple set of steps once you have installed homebrew on Mac:

--  Insure that all is up to date
brew update
brew doctor
brew upgrade

brew install mysql-connector-c

Q) How can I set up tests for Gnoga Applications?

A) There are many products on the market for testing Web sites / apps, any of those can be used with Gnoga as well. For example one inexpensive one for Mac is Fake.app http://fakeapp.com/

Q) Can I build native iOS apps for my iPhone or iPad?

A) In theory it should be possible using GNAT with an LLVM backend and PhoneGAP. I have not explored it yet.

Q) Can I build native Android Apps?

A) In theory it should be possible using gcc/ada with an Android target and PhoneGAP. I have not explored it yet.

Q) Can I build _native_ Chromebook apps?

A) It should be possible using gcc/ada, I have not yet explored the requirements for it, but Chromebooks are running Linux and Google does have a spec for it.

Q) Is it possible to use a reverse proxies / load balancers with Gnoga Apps?

A) Gnoga uses websockets which uses an http "upgrade" mechanism which means
the proxy or load balancer must have some knowledge of how to handle websockets. The two most popular Apache and Nginx support it:

For nginx see:
   http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html
   http://nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/

For Apache 2.4.5+ see:
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_wstunnel.html

Example of Gnoga application as its own domain:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName snake.gnoga.com
    ServerAdmin david@botton.com

    ProxyPass /gnoga ws://127.0.0.1:8080/gnoga
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/gnoga.err.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/gnoga.log common
</VirtualHost>

Example of a Gnoga application as a subdirectory on a larger site using Apache:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName gnoga.com
    ServerAlias www.gnoga.com
    ServerAdmin david@botton.com
    DocumentRoot /www/gnoga

    ProxyPass /snake http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ProxyPassReverse /snake http://www.gnoga.com:8080
    ProxyPass /gnoga ws://www.gnoga.com:8080/gnoga
    ProxyPass /js http://www.gnoga.com:8080/js

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/gnoga.err.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/gnoga.log common
</VirtualHost>

Q) Is it possible to use https and ssl websockets with Gnoga?

A) There are 2 methods, 1 is direct SSL support and second is to proxy support.

See ssl/gnoga-server-secure.ads for direct gnoga support of ssl. It requires libgnutls28-dev is installed.

Note:
When purchasing SSL certificates, when using gnutls such as with Gnoga direct ssl support or using Apache that also uses gnutls, append the intermediate certificate to the bottom of your certificate if there is one to properly create a chain of trust back to the root certificates installed in the browsers visiting your secure server.

Here is an example of using Apache to Proxy SSL:

Setup your proxy to use an ssl connection and use the secure.html boot loader:

1) Create your self signed certificate for testing. Of course for production you may want to purchase a real certificate:

openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -sha1 -newkey rsa:1024 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.crt -subj '/O=Botton/OU=Gnoga/CN=snake.gnoga.com'

2) I added a config:

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName snake.gnoga.com
    ServerAdmin david@botton.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /home/dbotton/workspace/ssl/server.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /home/dbotton/workspace/ssl/server.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /home/dbotton/workspace/ssl/intermediate_certs.crt

    ProxyPass /gnoga ws://127.0.0.1:8080/gnoga
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
</VirtualHost>

If you purchase your SSL certs from a CA that is lower tier you will need their intermediate certificate to validate their authority back to one of the main CAs. This is common for the less expensive SSL certs sold. This will also not be needed if using self generated certifcates for testing.

Now https://snake.gnoga.com/secure.html will be a secure connection.

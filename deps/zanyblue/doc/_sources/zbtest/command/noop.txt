The ``noop`` Command
====================

``noop``, the no operation command::

    noop

No operation.  The noop command does nothing and can be used in test
scripts that would otherwise be empty, e.g., running a script based
on the current platform::

    run $_platform

If, on Unix, no additional tests are needed, the file ``unix/unix.zbt``
can simply include the "noop" command (an empty file also works, however).

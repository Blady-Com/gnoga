Write status of a test area file to a log file.  This is frequently
used to verify the existence/non-existence of a file or directory in the
test area.  The information written to the file stat log file, for ordinary
files is:

   * The file name
   * The file type ("ORDINARY_FILE")
   * The file size in bytes
   * The time stamp associated with the file

For directories and other non-ordinary files only the file name and type is
writeen to the log file.

If the target file for the filestat command does not exist in the test area
the generated log file contains message

    The file "NAME" does not exist

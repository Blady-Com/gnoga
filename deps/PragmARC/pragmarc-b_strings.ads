-- Bounded, variable-length strings that are hopefully more usable than
-- Ada.Strings.Bounded provides
-- Based on an idea by Robert Duff presented on comp.lang.ada, which didn't work
--
-- History:
-- 2016 Jul 01     J. Carter          V1.3--Made type B_String tagged and non-limited
-- 2016 Mar 15     J. Carter          V1.2--Default discriminant doesn't work as Duff claimed, at least with GNAT
-- 2016 Feb 15     J. carter          V1.1--Forgot "+" for To_B_String
-- 2015 Nov 15     J. Carter          V1.0--Initial release
--

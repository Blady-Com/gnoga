   function Title return String;
   --  Set the name of the application. This will automatically set the
   --  browser window title to Name on new connections.

   procedure HTML_On_Close (HTML : String);
   function HTML_On_Close return String;
   --  Set the HTML that will display on all clients when connection is
   --  terminated or application is closed. By default an alert box will
   --  be displayed stating connection has been closed, but the current
   --  state of the browser window will be left as is. This value is
   --  sent on connection to application and therefore must be set before
   --  incoming connections. To change after connection has been established
   --  see Gnoga.Connections.HTML_On_Close

   --  The following browser launcher procedures spawn processes. On some
   --  OSes this can lead to instabilities for multi tasking apps if not
   --  spawned at program start. Therefore these if used should be used
   --  before the application initialization is called.

   procedure Open_URL_OSX (url : String := "http://127.0.0.1:8080");
   --  Open the default browser on Mac OS X

   --  Uses /usr/bin/xdg-open

   procedure Open_URL (url : String := "http://127.0.0.1:8080");
   --  By default this calls Open_URL_Linux, however the Makefile
   --  if it identfies Gnoga is being compiled on Mac OS X or Windows
   --  it will switch to use the appropriate procedure.

compare: compare a log file with a reference log

    Usage: compare log-file [ ref-log-file ]

The compare command compares (with regular expression matching) a
generated log file with a reference log file.  If the files match, a
.ok file is created and the number of OK tests is incremented, otherwise
a .fail file is created and the number of FAIL tests is incremented.

The reference log file is found by searching the searchpath parameter
and is normally in the same directory as the .zbt test script.

## Introduction
### How does it work?

### Mac App Store Compatible

MacGap which is used by Gnoga for native Mac apps makes use of WebViews which is a standard feature that is available when developing native OS X apps within Xcode. The API that is added is also based on official API's provided by Apple. Therefore there are no dirty hacks, no embedded chrome browser or anything that would stand in your way for Mac App Store submission.

This is a simple example of a WebKit2Gtk browser. It can be modifed and used as a front end to Gnoga apps instead of openning the system browser.

The following packages for ubuntu and debian are needed. Similar packages would be needed on other platforms or distros.

sudo apt-get install libwebkit2gtk-3.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev

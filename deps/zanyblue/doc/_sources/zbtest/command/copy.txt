The ``copy`` Command
====================

``copy``, copy a file to the test area::

    copy file [ target ]

Copy a file to the test area to use as input to commands under test.
The file copied is located by searching the directories listed on the
''searchpath'' parameter.

The file copied retains the name of the source file.  To use another name
the optional second argument can be used.

To copy a directory tree, the "-r" option should be used.

Examples

* copy xmpl.in
  Copy the file named "xmpl.in" to the test area retaining the name.

* copy xmpl.in example.dat
  Copy the file "xmpl.in" to the name "example.dat" in the test area.

* copy -r mydir
  Copy the directory "mydir" to the test area.

Files or directories copied to the test area are automatically removed
when the current scope exited (either at the end of the test script or
via an explicit "end").

--  This is a simple wrapper package around the standard Ada.Command_Line
--  package with Wide_String arguments and functions.  The underlying
--  Strings from Ada.Command_Line are simply interpreted as UTF-8 encoded
--  strings and are decoded to Wide_Strings.  This, obviously, does not
--  support UTF-8 encoded Wide_Wide_Strings.

The ``which`` Command
=====================

``which``, print the location of a file or command::

    which [ -e | -f ] name

Print the locations of files.  The zbtest locates various files during the
execution of a test script, e.g., the "copy" command will copy a data file
located via a search of the directories on the "searchpath" parameter, the
"execute" command uses the "path" parameter.  As an aid to debugging, the
"which" command print the results of these searches.  The options select
the type of file to search for:

* "-e" Search for a file that is executables
* "-f" Search for a file

The result is printed.

Example:

* Executeable::

    ZBTest> which -e ls
    /bin/ls

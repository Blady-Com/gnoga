This example is a simple text based application that uses the messages from
the TomCat server.  This example shows multiple facilities being compiled to
a single message package (the messages are also optimized for locale based
access, i.e., the messages for each locale are stored together).  A subset
of the message set is displayed for the current locale when run.

Since this example is based on an existing Java .properties file set, the
messages are externalized and are first compiled to the Ada package
Apache.Tomcat.Messages using zbmcompile.

Following the standard ZB convention, example applications are prefixed
with "x".

This example has no third party dependencies.

WARNING: Windows command windows do not support Unicode chararters.  This
example will display "garbage" if run on Windows for non-English locales.

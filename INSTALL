Gnoga can be installed as a gcc/ada standard library or can be used from its
install directory.

To install:

make release
sudo make install

gnat_make will also be installed in to the gcc/ada bin directory. Make sure to
check the permission on the gnat_make executable as some versions of gprinstall
fail to correctly change permissions to execute for all users.

# Gnoga _does not_ require installation, it is a convenience feature.

To use with out installing:

make release

gnat_make is found in the bin directory.

In your gpr file use:

with "/path/to/gnoga/src/gnoga.gpr" instead of with "gnoga"

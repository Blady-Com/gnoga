--  The ZanyBlue.Text.Codecs supports string encoding and decoding for
--  various encoding schemes, e.g., UTF-8, etc.

package ZanyBlue.Text.Codecs is

   type Codecs_Type is tagged private;
   --  Representation of a codec, encoding/decoding to/from an external
   --  encoding, e.g., "UTF-8", "ISO8859-1", etc.

   Unsupported_Encoding : exception;
   --  The environment defined or the library requested the usage of an
   --  encoding not supported by the library.  This exception is only
   --  raised if "Set_Unsupported_Encoding_Action" is called with the
   --  "Action" of "Raise_Exception".

   Unicode_Encode_Error : exception;
   --  The encoding of an Unicode string failed as it contained characters
   --  not representable in the encoding associated with the Codecs.  This
   --  exception is only raised if "Set_Unicode_Encode_Action" is called with
   --  the "Action" of "Raise_Exception".  If the "Action" is "Replace", then
   --  Unicode character un-encodeable using the selected encoding are simply
   --  replaced with the ASCII character '?'.

   Unicode_Decode_Error : exception;
   --  The decoding of a string encoding using the selected (Codecs defined)
   --  encoding could failed on encountering a sequence of characters not
   --  defined by the underyling encoding.  This exception is only raised if
   --  "Set_Unicode_Decode_Action" is called with the "Action" of
   --  "Raise_Exception".  If the "Action" is "Replace", then Unicode character
   --  un-decodeable character sequence is simply replaced with the ASCII
   --  character '?'.

   type Unsupported_Encoding_Action_Type is (Use_UTF8, Raise_Exception);
   --  How to handle user selection of an unsupported encoding.  The
   --  default is to simply use "UTF-8" for all unsupported encodings.

   type Unicode_XForm_Action_Type is (Replace, Raise_Exception);
   --  How to handle encoding or decoding errors, e.g., attempting to
   --  encoding an Unicode character not supported by the targe encoding.
   --  The default is to simply replace the character with the ASCII character
   --  '?'.

   type Implementation_Type is (Internal, Data_Driven);
   --  The internal ZanyBlue implementation of the encoding: either internal,
   --  i.e., directly implemented via internal routines, or data driven, i.e.,
   --  via code point mapping tables.

   procedure Set_Unsupported_Encoding_Action
      (Action : Unsupported_Encoding_Action_Type);

   --  "Unsupported_Encoding".

   --  Action to take when encoding from Unicode to the target encoding
   --  fails.  The default action is to simply replace the character with
   --  the ASCII character '?" (an "Action" value of "Replace").
   --  Alternatively, the exception "Unicode_Encode_Error" can be raised
   --  (an "Action" value of "Raise_Exception").

   procedure Set_Unicode_Decode_Action (Action : Unicode_XForm_Action_Type);
   --  Action to take when de`oding from a target encoded string to Unicode
   --  fails.  The default action is to simply replace the character(s) with
   --  the ASCII character '?" (an "Action" value of "Replace").

   --  Constraint_Error if there is no corresponding encoding.

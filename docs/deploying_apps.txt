The ideal structure to deploy your apps for production is the following
directory structure:

App Dir
  |
  |___ bin - your gnoga app binary
  |
  |___ html - boot.html (or other boot loader used)
  |
  |___ js - must contain jquery.min.js
  |
  |___ css - optional, a directory for serving css files
  |
  |___ img - optional, a directory of serving graphics.
  |
  |___ templates - optional, if using Gnoga.Server.Template_Parser
  |
  |___ upload - option, optional directory for incoming files

You can use Gnoga.Application.Lauch_URL_* to start a default browser
pointed to the Gnoga app on startup.

However, if any of the subdirectories is missing html is assumed and if html is
missing the App Dir is assumed. The executable can be in the bin directory or
in App Dir.

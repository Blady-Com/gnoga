Gnoga can be installed as a GNAT standard library on many platforms and
can always be used from its own directory.

1) To install release version in "inst_folder" directory:

$ make BUILD_MODE=Release install

gnoga_make will also be installed in to the bin directory. Make sure to
check the permission on the gnoga_make executable as some versions of gprinstall
fail to correctly change permissions to execute for all users.

In your gpr file use:
with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr:/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat

Tips: "make help" will give your actual GPR_PROJECT_PATH.

I you don't have Sqlite3, you can do before (automatic for Windows):
$ make sqlite3

The HTML files and Javascript plugins are in /path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gnoga.


2) To install debug version in "inst_folder" directory:

$ make install

Usage is same as release install.


3) Installation directory:

By default Gnoga and dependent libraries are installed in /path/to/gnoga/inst_folder directory.
Installation is customizable with PREFIX, as for instance:

sudo make PREFIX=/path/to/install install

In your gpr file use:
with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/install/share/gpr -aP/path/to/install/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/install/share/gpr:/path/to/install/lib/gnat
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/install/share/gpr;/path/to/install/lib/gnat

NB: Zanyblue installation doesn't support paths including space character.


4) Using from Gnoga's own directory without installing in debug build mode:
(to play with Gnoga source code, demos, tutorials or even tests)

make all

In your own gpr file use:
with "/path/to/gnoga/src/gnoga.gpr" (instead of with "gnoga") and with "/path/to/gnoga/settings.gpr".

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr:/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat

These options are automatically computed for you with gnoga-config.
The script is created a first time with makefile and then can be use without makefile.
gnoga-config sets the search project directories for gprbuild.

a) For Windows users:
Usage:
> cd <gnoga-repo>
> make gnoga-config
> cd <your-stuff>
> <gnoga-repo>\build\bin\gnoga-config gprbuild -P your-project.gpr your-main.adb
(your-project.gpr just have to include 'with "gnoga";')
You can also add <gnoga-repo>\build\bin to your PATH and then just do:
gnoga-config gprbuild -P your-project.gpr your-main.adb

b) For Unix like users:
Usage:
$ cd <gnoga-repo>
$ make gnoga-config
$ cd <your-stuff>
$ gprbuild -P your-project.gpr your-main.adb `<gnoga-repo>/build/bin/gnoga-config`
(your-project.gpr just have to include 'with "gnoga";')
You can also add <gnoga-repo>/build/bin to your PATH and then just do:
$ gprbuild -P your-project.gpr your-main.adb `gnoga-config`

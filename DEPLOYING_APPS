Inorder to deploy your apps for production you need to have the following
directory structure:

App Dir
  |
  |___ bin - your gnoga app binary
  |
  |___ html - boot.html (or other boot loader used)
  |
  |___ js - must contain jquery.min.js and jquery-ui.min.js
  |
  |___ css - must contain jquery-ui.css
  |
  |___ img - optional, a directory of serving graphics.


During development the following works well:

App Dir
  |
  |___ bin - your gnoga app binary
  |
  |___ html - boot.html (or other boot loader used)
  |
  |___ js - must contain jquery.min.js and jquery-ui.min.js
  |
  |___ css - must contain jquery-ui.css
  |
  |___ img - optional, a directory of serving graphics.
  |
  |___ src - Source code for your gnoga app
  |
  |___ obj - Build objects
  
  The basic gpr file (assuming you have run "make install" to install gnoga as a library in gnat) for this setup of dirs would be (using my_app.gpr):
  
  with "Gnoga";

  project My_App is

     for Languages use ("Ada");
     for Source_Dirs use (".");
     for Object_Dir use "../obj";
     for Exec_Dir use "../bin";
     for Main use ("my_app-main.adb");
     
     package Builder is
        for Executable ("my_app-main.adb") use "myapp";
     end Builder;

     package Compiler is
        for Default_Switches ("ada") use ("-E");
     end Compiler;
  end My_App;

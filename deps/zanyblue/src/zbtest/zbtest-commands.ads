   Unknown_Command_Error : exception;
   --  Exception raised if an unknown command is entered.

   Command_Usage_Error   : exception;
   --  Exception raised by command implementations if the arguments are
   --  invalid.

   Command_Table_Not_Sorted : exception;
   --  The commands are stored in an internal lookup table which is expected
   --  to be sorted.  If the table is not sorted, i.e., a coding error, then
   --  this exception is raised with the command name as an argument.

   type Command_Type is access procedure (State   : in out State_Type;

   --  list of arguments.  A dispatch table is maintained mapping command
   --  names to implementations (this access type).

   function Number_Of_Commands return Positive;
   --  Return the number of known commands.  This routine is primarily used
   --  by the "help" command to iterate over available commands.

   function Command_Name (Index : Natural) return Wide_String;
   --  Given a command index, return the corresponding command name.  This
   --  routine is primarily used by the "help" command to iterate over
   --  available commands.

   function Find (Name : Wide_String) return Command_Type;
   --  Given a command name, return the implementation.  Unknown commands
   --  return an implementation that simply raises Unknown_Command_Error.

   procedure Print_Command_Help (Name : Wide_String);
   --  Print the help information for a command.

   procedure Print_Command_Usage (Name : Wide_String);
   --  Print the usage message for a command.

   procedure Print_Command_Summary (Name  : Wide_String;
                                    Index : Positive);
   --  Print the message for the one line summary description associated
   --  with the named command.  The message returned includes a argument
   --  for the command number: the help command lists the summary lines with
   --  a sequence number.

00022=The Debug console allow you to easily debug a remote connection. If \
checked, it will open a console reporting all exchanges between GPS and the \
selected server.
00023=Debug console:
00024=CR/LF Handling:
00025=The maximum number of connections determines the maximum number \
of simultaneous connections GPS is allowed to perform to this \
server. In fact, if you want to compile, debug and execute at \
the same time on the machine, GPS will need more that one \
connection to do this. The default value is 3.
00026=Max number of connections:
00027=The timeout value is used to determine if a connection to a \
remote host is dead. All elementary operations performed on the \
remote host (i.e. operations that are normally almost immediate \
to perform) will use this timeout value. By default, this value \
is set to 10s. If you have a very slow network connection or a \
very overloaded server, set this timeout to a higher value.
00028=Timeout value (in s):
00029=The user name specifies the name used to connect to the server. \
If unspecified, the remote access tool will most of the time \
use your current login name. If not, and a user name is \
requested, gps will prompt you for a user name when requested.)
00030=User name:
00031=Advanced configuration
00032=The Extra Init Commands field represents initialization commands \
sent to the server upon connection: when GPS connects to your \
remote machine, the chosen shell is launched, and your default \
initialization files are read (e.g. .bashrc file for the bash \
shell). Then GPS sends these extra init commands, allowing you \
for example to specify a compilation toolchain.
00033=Extra init commands:
00034=The sync tool is used to synchronize remote and local \
filesystems, if these are not shared filesystems.
00035=Sync tool:
00036=The shell tells GPS what shell runs on the remote server.

00038=No suitable remote access tool could be found on your system.\n\
A remote access tool is required to be able to use the GPS remote features. \

details):\n\
\ - rlogin\n\
\ - ssh\n\
\ - telnet
00039=The remote access tool is the tool used to connect to this server.
00040=<span foreground="red">*</span> Remote access tool:
00041=The network name is the name used to connect to this server via \
your network. It can be either an IP address, a host name of \
your local network, or a fully qualified network name.

00048=Indicates what characters the remote host understands as line ending: \
LF, CR/LF, or automatically determine it.
00049=Five kinds of path synchronization can be set for each defined path:\n\
* Never: no synchronization is required from GPS, the paths are shared using \
an OS mechanism like NFS.\n\
* Manually: synchronization is needed, but will only be performed manually \
using the remote view buttons.\n\
* Always: the paths are kept synchronised by GPS before and after every \
remote action (e.g. build).\n\
* To local/remote: The project's dependencies are synchronized once when a \
remote project is loaded or when a local project is set remote. They can be \
still manually synchronized using the Remote View.

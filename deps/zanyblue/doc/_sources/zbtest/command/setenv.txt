The ``setenv`` Command
======================

``setenv``, set an environment variable::

    setenv [ -l | -p ] variable value

Set an environment variable to a value, e.g.,::

    ZBTest> setenv PROFILE yes
    Setting the environment variable "PROFILE" to "yes"

sets the variable "PROFILE" to the value "yes" for the current process and
any processes created using the "execute" command.  The definition is
scoped and is reverted when the current scope exits (normally at the end of
a test script).  The reversion is either by deleting the environment
variable it did not have a current value or by restoring the value prior
to the setenv.

The options allow the definition of environment variables based on the
value of parameters.  For simple definitions, the "-p" option can be used,
e.g.,::

    ZBTest> set LLW Lilongwe
    ZBTest> setenv -p DESTINATION LLW
    Setting the environment variable "DESTINATION" to "Lilongwe"

parameters are converted to strings for these simple definitions.  If the
parameter is a list, the "-l" option can be used which concatenates the
list elements into string separated by the OS separator character.   This
can be used to set PATH values, etc., e.g.,::

    ZBTest> set mypath /bin
    ZBTest> append mypath /usr/bin
    ZBTest> setenv -l PATH mypath
    Setting the environment variable "PATH" to "/bin:/usr/bin"

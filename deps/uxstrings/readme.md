# Unicode Extended Strings (UXStrings)

[Gnoga](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnoga) internal character strings implementation is based on both Ada types String and Unbounded\_String.
The native Ada String encoding is Latin-1 whereas transactions with the Javascript part are in UTF-8 encoding.

Some drawbacks come up, for instance,  with internationalization of programs (see [Localize Gnoga demo](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnoga/code/ci/dev_1.6/tree/demo/localize)):

* several conversions between String and Unbounded\_String objects
* it isn't usable out of Latin-1 character set, characters out of Latin-1 set are blanked
* continuous conversions between Latin-1 and UTF-8, each sent and received transaction between Ada and Javascript parts

Two ways of improvement: native dynamic length handling and Unicode support.

First possibility is using UTF-8 as internal implementation in Unbounded\_String objects.
The simplest way but Gnoga uses many times character indexes to parse Javascript messages that is not easy to achieved with UTF-8 which may have several lengths to represent one character. String parsing will be time consuming. Some combinations may lead to incorrect UTF-8 representation.

Second possibility is to use Unbounded\_Wide\_String or Unbounded\_Wide\_Wide\_String.
Using Unbounded\_Wide\_String is quite being in the middle of the river might as well use Unbounded\_Wide\_Wide\_String. In this latter case the memory penalty is heavy for only few accentuated character occurrences. So back to Unbounded\_Wide\_String but you'll miss the so essential emojis ;-)

Third possibility is to make no choice between Latin-1, Wide and Wide\_Wide characters. The object shall adapt its inner implementation to the actual content.
For instance with English language the most often use case will be Latin-1 inner implementation, for French language the most often will be Latin-1 with some exceptions with BMP (Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane) implementation such as in "c≈ìur", for Greek language the most often will be BMP implementation.
The programer won't make any representation choice when for example receiving UTF-8 messages:

``` ada
   S2 : UXString;
   ...
   S2 := "Received: " & From_UTF8 (Message);
```

Automatically S2 will adapt its inner representation to the received characters.

Package named UXStrings (Unicode Extended String) is containing :

The first part contains renaming statements of Ada types.
Ada String type is structurally an array of Latin-1 characters thus is renamed as Latin\_1\_Character\_Array.
And so on.

The second part defines the USXString type as a tagged private type which has got aspects such as Constant\_Indexing, Variable\_Indexing and Iterable, so we can write:

``` ada
   S1, S2, S3 : UXString;
   C          : Character;
   WC         : Wide_Character;
   WWC        : Wide_Wide_Character;
   ...
   C   := S1 (3);
   WC  := S1 (2);
   WWC := S1 (1);
   S1 (3) := WWC;
   S1 (2) := WC;
   S1 (1) := C;
   for I in S3 loop
      C   := S3 (I);
      WC  := S3 (I);
      WWC := S3 (I);
      Put_Line (Character'pos (C)'img & Wide_Character'pos (WC)'img & Wide_Wide_Character'pos (WWC)'img);
   end loop;
```

The third part defines conversion functions between UXString and various encoding such as Latin-1, BMP (USC-2), Unicode (USC-4), UTF-8 or UTF-16, so we can write:

``` ada
   S1  := From_Latin_1 ("blah blah");
   S2  := From_BMP ("une soir√©e pass√©e √† √©tudier la physique œâ=ŒîŒ∏/Œît...");
   S3  := From_Unicode ("une soir√©e pass√©e √† √©tudier les math√©matiques ‚Ñï‚äÇùïÇ...");
   Send (To_UTF_8 (S1) & To_UTF_8 (S3));
```

The fourth part defines various API coming from Unbounded\_String such as Append, "&", Slice, "=", Index and so on.

The private and implementation parts are not yet defined.
One idea is to use the XStrings from [GNATColl](https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatcoll-core/blob/master/src/gnatcoll-strings_impl.ads).

Feel free to send feedback about UXStrings specification source code on [Gnoga mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnoga/mailman/gnoga-list).

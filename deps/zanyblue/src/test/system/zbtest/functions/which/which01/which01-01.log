The "which" function returns the path to a file searched on the
"searchpath" list, using the "-f" option (the default) or an executable
on the "path" list, using the "-e" option.

The "which" function is primarily used to determine where applications are
installed with the result normally processed by the "dirname" function to
to determine the parent directory, e.g.

    ZBTest> set project_dir $(dirname $(dirname $(which zbmcompile)))

where "project_dir" is set to "/usr/zb" for an installed "zbmcompile" located
at "/usr/zb/bin/zbmcompile".

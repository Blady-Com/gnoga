The "nextlog" function returns the next log name for the current test
based on a sequence controlled by the "_lognum" parameter.  By default, an
undo action is also created to compare the generated log name with a reference
log file on exiting the test scope.  The undo action creation is suppressed if
the "-n" option is given.  The format of the log file name generated is

    TESTNAME-nn.log

where "TESTNAME" is the name of the current test and "nn" the sequence number.
The use of the "nextlog" function can simplify test scripts, e.g.,

    execute -o mytest-01.log mycmd1
    execute -o mytest-02.log mycmd2
    compare mytest-01.log
    compare mytest-02.log

can be re-written as

    execute -o $(nextlog) mycmd1
    execute -o $(nextlog) mycmd2

The "-c" option can be used to start a new log naming sequence for log files
that are not part of the normal test reference logs, e.g., the output of
the build commands to generate an executable are too platform specific to
to be used as reference log files but the output should be stored in a
log file for debugging.  The argument to the "-c" option is the name of
an integer parameter which is used to sequence the log file name (the
parameter is created if it does not already exist in the current scope)

By default, log file using alternative counter names do not create
undo actions to execute the compare command.  If the log files should
be compared on scope exit, the "-n" option can be used.

For example, save the output of a build command:

    execute -o $(nextlog -c build) build.sh

would generate the log file TESTNAME-build-nn.log, the counter name
is embedded in the log file.

GNOGA - The GNU Omnificent GUI for Ada
http://www.gnoga.com

Documentation and more demos to come.

For now run:

make

then run the snake demo in /bin

There are other test bins in the /bin you can also take a look at but they are mainly used during development to test the framework as I go.

You can now install gnoga as a gnat library using:

make install

Look through the code in the tests and the snake demo to get a feel for how things work for now.

Gnoga has the following aspects to it:

1. The underlying communication platform between the Ada code and the browser
	Gnoga.Connections

2. Binding the DOM for later higher level development
        Gnoga.Base (Not per se a binding of Node but takes its place)
        Gnoga.Element, Gnoga.Element.* (HTML Elements)
        Gnoga.Window, Gnoga.Navigator, Gnoga.Screen, Gnoga.Location
        Gnoga.Document (Browser and higher level aspects of the DOM).

3. Application startup and services
        Gnoga.Application.*

4. Bindings to higher level toolkits like jQueryUI, Bootstrap, etc.
        Coming soon

5. Gnoga Specific higher level containers and GUI widgets
       Coming soon

6. Gnoga Application level APIs, like Logical access control systems, Security services and monitoring, etc.
       Coming soon

7. Gnoga database bindings
	Gnoga.Server.Database - support for MySQL and SQLite 3
	Gnoga.Server.Model - Active Data models like in Rails
        Gnoga.Server.Migrations - Rails like database schema migrations

8. Gnoga development tools
	Code generation for binding pre-made html5 pages
        Database tools for generating front ends, etc.
	   - I already have a tool for create delailed Active Data bindings
	   - per tables, that will be added in the near future.
	IDE for Delphi/VB like development
	etc.

Gnoga can be installed as a Gnat standard library on many platforms and
can always be used from its own directory.

1) To install release version in "inst_folder" directory:

$ make release
$ make install

gnoga_make will also be installed in to the bin directory. Make sure to
check the permission on the gnoga_make executable as some versions of gprinstall
fail to correctly change permissions to execute for all users.

In your gpr file use:
with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr:/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat

Tips: "make help" will give your actual GPR_PROJECT_PATH.

To install also Zanyblue and Pragmarc, you can do before:
$ make zanyblue
$ make pragmarc

I you don't have Sqlite3, you can do before (automatic for Windows):
$ make sqlite3


2) To install debug version (to play with Gnoga source code, demos, tutorials or even tests) in "inst_folder" directory:

$ make all
$ make install_debug

In your gpr file use:
with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr:/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat
or for Windows
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/inst_folder/lib/gnat

Tips: "make help" will give your actual GPR_PROJECT_PATH.


3) Installation directory:

By default Gnoga and dependent libraries are installed in /path/to/gnoga/inst_folder directory.
Installation is customizable with PREFIX, as for instance:

sudo make PREFIX=/path/to/install install
or
sudo make PREFIX=/path/to/install install_debug

In your gpr file use:
with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/install/share/gpr -aP/path/to/install/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/install/share/gpr:/path/to/install/lib/gnat
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/install/share/gpr;/path/to/install/lib/gnat

NB: Zanyblue installation doesn't support paths including space character.


4) Using from Gnoga's own directory without installing:

make release
or
make all

gnoga_make is found in the bin directory.

In your own gpr file use:
with "/path/to/gnoga/src/gnoga.gpr" (instead of with "gnoga") and with "/path/to/gnoga/settings.gpr".

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat
or for Unix like
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr:/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat
or for Windows
set GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat

00001=The selected path does not contain a compiler.\n\
Are you sure you want to use this path ?
00002=Invalid compiler path
00003=Toolchains Configuration
00004=Activate multiple toolchains setup
00005=Paths
00006=Compiler path
00007=This path will be used to spawn all code generation actions.\n\
In particular gnatmake, gprbuild, gcc, gdb, gcov will be searched for in \
this path.\n\
To compile your project with a specific version of a compiler, please choose \
its bin directory here.\n\
This path should be different from the tools path.\n\n\
Note concerning the interaction with the remote mode:\n\
In case you have defined a build server for your project, then this path \
will be ignored, and the regular server''s search path will be used.
00008=Tools path
00009=This path will be used to spawn all actions not related to code \
generation. These actions are (the list is not exclusive) gnatcheck, \
gnatmetrics, cross-reference generation.\n\
This path should be different from the compiler path.\n\n\
Note concerning the interaction with the remote mode:\n\
In case you have defined a build server for your project, then defining a \
tools path will make all actions enumerated above execute locally using the \
tools path.
00010=Use this button to select the folder with a file explorer
00011=Use the compiler in tools path to generate cross-reference files
00012=If checked, then GPS will automatically generate cross reference files \
(.ali files) upon compilations. It will use the compiler found in the tools \
path to generate those cross reference files and will place them in a \
specific subdirectory, so as not to interract with objects and cross \
reference files generated by the regular compiler used for actually building \
the project.\n\n\
This functionnality is used to allow full GPS functionalities with old \
compilers. If you need to use an old compiler with your project, then you \
might consider using this feature.

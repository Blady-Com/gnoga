GNOGA - The GNU Omnificent GUI for Ada
http://www.gnoga.com

Read through each README starting with /tutorial for the basics on writing Gnoga applications.

For now run:

make

then run the snake demo in /bin

There are other test bins in the /bin you can also take a look at but they are mainly used during development to test the framework as I go the tutorials are better examples of how to program Gnoga.

You can now install gnoga as a gnat library using:

make install

Look through the code in the tests and the snake demo to get a feel for how things work for now.

Gnoga has the following aspects to it:

1. The underlying communication platform between the Ada code and the browser
      Gnoga.Server.Connections

2. Binding the DOM for later higher level development
        Gnoga.Gui.Base (Not per se a binding of Node but takes its place)
        Gnoga.Gui.Element, Gnoga.Gui.Element.* (HTML Elements)
        Gnoga.Gui.Element.Canvas - HTML 5 Canvas bindings
        Gnoga.Gui.Element.Multimedia - HTML 5 Audio and Video
        Gnoga.Gui.Window, Gnoga.Gui.Navigator, Gnoga.Gui.Screen,
        Gnoga.Gui.Location
        Gnoga.Gui.Document (Browser and higher level aspects of the DOM).

3. Application startup and services
        Gnoga.Server.Application.*

4. Bindings to higher level toolkits like jQueryUI, Bootstrap, etc.
        Coming soon

5. Gnoga Specific higher level containers and GUI widgets
        Gnoga.Views.* - Auto layout of child elements and basis for future
                          custom Gnoga widgts

6. Gnoga Application level APIs, like Logical access control systems, Security services and monitoring, etc.
       Gnoga.Client.Storage - local persistent and session storage on browser

7. Gnoga database bindings
	   Gnoga.Server.Database - support for MySQL and SQLite 3
      Gnoga.Server.Model - Active Data models like in Rails
      Gnoga.Server.Migrations - Rails like database schema migrations

8. Gnoga development tools
	Code generation for binding pre-made html5 pages
        Database tools for generating front ends, etc.
	   - I already have a tool for create delailed Active Data bindings
	   - per tables, that will be added in the near future.
	IDE for Delphi/VB like development
	etc.

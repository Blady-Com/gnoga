LinXtris Version 0.1

This project is just begining so I haven't made an installation script yet.

To compile this game you must have the Gnat compiler and the development and runtime libraries for
Gtk+ 2.0 and GtkAda 2.0 installed.

Untar the package in a directory with:
# tar -zxvf linxtris-0.1.tar.gz

Enter the directory just created:
# cd linxtris

To compile type:
# make

And to run:
#./linxtris

Hope you enjoy!

--  This package provides a  generator  of  non-repeating  sequences  of
--  items.  The sequence generated can be made random when the output of
--  a  random  generator  is  used.  The sequence items are of a modular
--  type.  It  is  not  recommened  to  use  large  types  because   the
--  implementation requires O(n) space where n  is the type modulo.  The
--  package is generic with the formal parameter:
--
--      Item_Type - The sequence items type
--
--  Note  that  the  sequences  are  generated  from  Item_Type'Base.  A
--  sequence  contains  all  values  of  Item_Type'Base.  Items start to
--  repeat if more than Item_Type'Base'Modulus generated.
--
--  The sequence items can be used in cipher-block chaining and feedback
--  modes in order to improve cryptographic strength.

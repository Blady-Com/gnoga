have to do.

00019=Whether the lines matching the regexp should be hidden when the output \
is displayed in the GPS window. This allows tools to output special lines \

00108=If you are using a GNAT version more recent than 2007-09-21, \
cross-references on dispatching calls can list all the subprograms that might \
be called at run time. However, computing this info might take some time, and \
the preference lets you chose how GPS should behave:\n\
Never: no special submenu is displayed for dispatching calls\n\
From Memory: only the information already available in memory is used. Some \
possible subprograms will not be listed\n\
Accurate: GPS will reload the cross-references information from the disk as \
needed. This might result in long delays (up to several seconds) if lots of \
information needs to be loaded. This method is always used when computing \
dispatching information in call graphs.

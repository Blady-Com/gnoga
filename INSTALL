Gnoga can be installed as a gcc/ada standard library on many platforms and
can always be used from its own directory.

1) To install release version in build directory:

make release
make install

gnoga_make will also be installed in to the gcc/ada bin directory. Make sure to
check the permission on the gnoga_make executable as some versions of gprinstall
fail to correctly change permissions to execute for all users.

In your gpr file use:

with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat
or
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat


2) To install debug version in build directory:

make all
make install_debug

In your gpr file use:

with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat
or
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat


3) Installation directory:

By default Gnoga and dependent libraries are installed in /path/to/gnoga/build directory.
Installation is customizable with PREFIX, as for instance:

sudo make PREFIX=/path/to/install install
or
sudo make PREFIX=/path/to/install install_debug

In your gpr file use:

with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/install/share/gpr -aP/path/to/install/lib/gnat
or
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/install/share/gpr;/path/to/install/lib/gnat


4) Using from Gnoga's own directory without installing:

make release
or
make all

gnoga_make is found in the bin directory.

In your gpr file use:

with "/path/to/gnoga/src/gnoga.gpr" instead of with "gnoga"

and add this option to your grpbuild: -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr -aP/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat
or
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/gnoga/build/share/gpr;/path/to/gnoga/build/lib/gnat

Creating test area directory ".*test-area"
Executing the ZBTest script ".*help.zbt"
zbtest.help (1) desc Test the help text for the zbtest end command
Set the test description to "Test the help text for the zbtest end command"
zbtest.help (2) 
zbtest.help (3) help end
end: end a parameter scope returning to previous scope

    Usage: end

Exit a parameter scope.  Any assignments to made duing the scope
are lost.  Previous definitions are restored, e.g.,::

    ZBTest> set xyz abc
    ZBTest> begin
    ZBTest> set xyz 123
    ZBTest> echo $xyz
    ZBTest> end
    ZBTest> echo $xyz

The first "echo" prints the value "123" which the second prints the value
"abc".

It not normally necessary to use the "begin" and "end" commands as running
a test script automatically start a new scope which is ended when the
script completes.

The "end" command also executes any "end actions" defined by commands
executed during the scope.  E.g., the "copy" command add an "end action"
to remove the file or directory copied into the test area.

run: run another ZBTest script

    Usage: run script

Run a script given the script name, i.e., without the "zbt" extension.
The script should either be in the current directory or in a sub-directory
with the same name as the script, e.g., "run xmpl", will try the files::

    xmpl.zbt
    xmpl/xmpl.zbt

Once located, the ZBTest commands in the script are executed within the
context of a new implicit scope.  Modifications to the environment made
by the script are discarded (via undo actions) when the script completes.

E00002=Usage: zbmcompile [ options ] package facility\n\
where available options are\n\
\  -q             Quiet mode\n\
\  -v             Verbose mode\n\
\  -A             Generate only ASCII source files\n\
\  -m             Always include argument modes in generated code\n\
\  -p             Number list entries (gnatcheck +RPositional_Components)\n\
\  -D             Debug mode (dump the catalog definitions)\n\
\  -d directory   Directory containing facility (defaults to ".")\n\
\  -e extension   Properties extension (default "properties")\n\
\  -i             Include initialization call in body\n\
\  -O             Optimize string pool for locale based access\n\
\  -g             Disable locale based access optimization (default)\n\
\  -B             Compile only the base locale\n\
\  -u             Disable consistency checked (unchecked mode)\n\
\  -L locale      Compile only the named locale, e.g., "fr", "fr_FR"\n\
\  -r locale      Define reference (base) locale for consistency checking\n\
\  -s locale      Define source root locale\n\
\  -S stamp-file  File to always create/update (contains a timestamp)\n\
\  -x name        Define external name for Initialize procedure\n\
\  -F             Force generation, ignoring errors.  Generated code might\n\
\                 not compile\n\
\  -a             Generate all accessors ([w]prints, [w]strings, exceptions)\n\
\  -G name        Generate named accessor ([w]prints, [w]strings, exceptions)\n\
\  -C             Disable comments on generated accessor routines\n\
\  -T item size   Set the size of an Ada output limit: pool or comment\n\
\  -X handling    Handling of non-Ada keys for accessors (error, ignore)

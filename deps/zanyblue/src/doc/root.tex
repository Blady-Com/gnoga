\chapter{The Root Package}

The ZanyBlue root package, \texttt{ZanyBlue} contains definitions
about the library, primiarly version information.  The version
numbers associated with the library are available via the
functions
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Version\_Major}, the major version number for the ZanyBlue
      release.
\item \texttt{Version\_Minor}, the minor version number for the ZanyBlue
      release.
\item \texttt{Version\_Patch}, the patch number for the ZanyBlue release.
\end{itemize}

Each release also has a release status given by the function
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
  function Version_Status_Type return Version_Status_Type;
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
The return value is an enumeration type: Alpha, Beta, Production.

To futher refine the release identification, a source code
revision value (a wide string) is returned by the function
\texttt{Revision}.  The source code system is currently Subversion
and this string has the format of the letter ``\texttt{r}'' followed by the
Subversion revision number, e.g., ``\texttt{r2500}''.

Finally, the copyright year for the bundle is given by the function
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
  function Copyright_Year return Positive;
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
This is current year at the time of the build.

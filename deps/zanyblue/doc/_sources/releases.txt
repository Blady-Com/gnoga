Releases
========

The ZanyBlue releases are distributed when functionality has been completed.
The following section detail the contents of the releases.

.. _v1.3.0b:

Version 1.3.0b, Aug 6th, 2016
-----------------------------

#. Added a new utility ``zbinfo`` to query built-in data.  This was released
   as an example previously (the ``dumplocale`` example which has been
   dropped).
#. Added encoding support to convert ``Wide_String`` values to ``String`` based
   on an encoding schema, e.g., ``UTF-8``, ``ISO8859-2``, ``CP932``,
   ``SHIFT_JIS``, etc.  To fully use this functionality, narrow accessors
   should be used which, when printing, use ``Stream_IO`` to avoid interaction
   between the ``Text_IO`` and encoded values.  The list of supported
   encodings is available via ``zbinfo --list-encodings``.
#. The default locale is now ``en_US.UTF-8`` if no other locale can be
   determined from the environment.
#. Updated the documentation (and website) to use the Sphinx documentation
   system.
#. Updated and expanded the documentation.  Additional documentation is,
   however, needed.  Switch to ``gnatdoc`` from ``gnathtml`` to generate
   the source code based documentation.
#. Restricted the usage of the ``-gnatW8`` compilation option to just the
   source files containing UTF-8 encoded strings: the message pool file
   generated by the ``zbmcompile`` utility.
#. Added option to the ``zbmcompile`` utility to generate ASCII only source
   files (``-A`` option).
#. Added option to the ``zbmcompile`` utility to define handling of non-Ada
   message keys when generating accessors (the ``-X`` option).
#. Updated the build to use ``gprbuild`` instead of ``gnatmake``.
#. Updated the build to use ``-gnat2012`` in all gpr files.
#. Switched from ``AUnit`` to ``Ahven`` for unit testing.
#. Minor source code changes based on stricter checkes with GNAT 2016.

.. _v1.2.1b:

Version 1.2.1b, Sep 13th, 2015
------------------------------

#. Minor patch update to handle stricter checks with the latest GNAT release

.. _v1.2.0b:

Version 1.2.0b, Mar 10th, 2014
------------------------------

#. Updates for building with GNAT 2013
#. Moved usage of Generic packages to library level (stricted accessibility
   checks with GNAT2013)
#. Dropped definition of "ld run path" definition (created issues on MacOS)
#. Updated CLDR data to v24 Release (see cldr.unicode.org)
#. Allow localization for +/- characters to be multi-character strings
#. Improved errors messages for invalid zbmcompile command line arguments
#. Implemented message filtering for all Print routines
#. Added directory tree level initialation files for zbtest
#. Bugfixes, e.g., handling OS LANG values with dashes in the encoding
#. Some documentation updates
#. Added a patch to ZanyBlue-ize GNAT GPS 5.2.1 (released with GNAT 2013)

.. _v1.1.0b:

Version 1.1.0b, Jul 2nd, 2012
-----------------------------

#. Updates for building with GNAT 2012 (major driver for this release)
#. Added a patch to ZanyBlue-ize GNAT GPS 5.1.1 (released with GNAT 2012)
   The resultant executable is identical to the standard gps but with support
   for pseudo translation (no real attempt is made to supply localized
   properties files for gps)

.. _v1.0.0b:

Version 1.0.0b, Apr 30th, 2012
------------------------------

Major changes in this release are:

#. Change of licensing from GPLv2 to simple BSD
#. Message accessors to make using messages safer (the Ada compiler can
   check for argument types and number)
#. A simple regression testing application for command line utilities
#. A parameter storage package (internally used for command line and for
   parameter storage during regression tests)

.. _v0.1.0b:

Version 0.1.0b, Nov 26th, 2010
